## formula-engine plans

### Big Picture Ideas
 * Get bindings between `GameEngine Units` and `Scriptables` working nicely
 * Implement coordinate support
 * Add ability for `Units` to move around, driven by script
 * Add "collision"
 * Implement combat resolution entirely in script
 * Implement debug visualizations for all this stuff
 * Build an elegant way to propagate time forwards (FRP?)
 * Polish the KingdomWar script/simulation module

### Sept. 8, 2015
Mostly intend to do documentation and cleanup work for a little while. Would like to start circulating the project a bit and gathering early feedback, so it would help if the stuff was readable and properly commented.
