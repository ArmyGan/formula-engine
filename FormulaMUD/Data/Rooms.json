Almost like children, they simply feel curious towards you - no apprehension or suspicion, like villagers normally might percieve outsiders. You suspect it's the effect of the hymn, which has grown stronger, but only underscores the sounds of life going on otherwise. You feel its effects as well - you know the villagers are, ultimately, harmless, simple people. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aTo the north, you can hear the hawking of various shopkeepers trying to sell their wares. Primitive though this village may be, they seem to still have bustling commerce.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aTo the south, you see what amounts to a large tent-building. There is a plume of smoke coming from the tent. You suspect you could rest there, for a fee, and perhaps there's some sort of fire you could warm your now-numb body with.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aTo the west, you see a large and ornate tent. No villagers seem to be coming or going from there. And yet, the hymn seems to be beckoning you in, as if its been waiting for you this whole time...\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aExits:\u000d\u000aEast\u000d\u000aNorth\u000d\u000aSouth\u000d\u000aWest\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a   [ ]\u000d\u000a[ ][#][ ][ ][ ]\u000d\u000a   [ ]",

As you try to take in your surroundings, you realize that this tent has been the source of the hymn this whole time. Just as you process this realization, the room is suddenly lit by a flame in the center of the room and the hymn comes to an end. A mighty figure gradually stands to her feet on the other end of the tent.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\"Another one... You...\"\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\"I wonder, which path will you follow?

Her fur gleams in the light of the flame she's created, almost seeming like fire itself.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\"Young adventurer, welcome to the town of Pruina.

Experience the likes of things you never thought possible.\"\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aSuddenly, a great howl burst forth from the god. It echoes across the whole forest. The force of the cry nearly knocks you down, though sheer force of will keeps you upright. The flame in the center of the room erupts, seemingly engulfing the whole tent. The flames do not burn you, however, merely playfully lick at you, lightly singing your clothing.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe flames die back down as the howl fades, revealing a gleaming instrument in front of you. It's warm to the touch, as if newly forged. As you take it, the flame dies back down, submerging the god into darkness as she retakes her seat.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\"Go forth.
